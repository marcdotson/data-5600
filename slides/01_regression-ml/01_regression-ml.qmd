- Make introductions
- Form groups to work on projects
- Walk through the course syllabus
- Provide some context for what we'll be studying

# Introductions

## DATA 5600

This course introduces machine learning for **business analytics**, including linear, logistic, and penalized regression. Students apply the modeling workflow by building **interpretable models**, evaluating assumptions, and communicating results for **real-world problems**. Prerequisites: DATA 3100 and DATA 3300

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Build, evaluate, and interpret models to inform decision-making for non-technical stakeholders.
2. Diagnose and address violations of model assumptions to ensure appropriate model use.
3. Communicate model results clearly in a business context.

::: {.column width="60%"}
Success in this course is demonstrating conceptual understanding and skill mastery by applying the modeling workflow in your chosen business context and as part of a group

You are each an essential member of a community of learners and should consider me as both a teacher and a mentor

## Focus on learning

1. Prepare for class by previewing material and identifying questions
2. Engage during class by asking questions, taking notes, and actively coding
3. Apply what you learn in class by completing exercises and working on projects
4. Evaluate what you're learning by reviewing and reflecting on course materials and exercise solutions
5. Reinforce what you're learning by utilizing office hours and working with classmates

- [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is a general purpose, open source programming language
- It is the most commonly used programming language for data analytics
- Python will be required for the course
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#sec-python) for details on how to best install and manage Python versions and project environments

- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) is a critical data tool
- I recommend [Positron](https://positron.posit.co), a next-generation data science IDE
- Positron combines the multilingual extensibility of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with essential data tools common to language-specific IDEs
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#sec-positron) for a summary of Positron's data-friendly features

- [GitHub](https://github.com/about) hosts version-controlled project repositories managed with Git
- It is the industry standard for software development and data projects
- Using GitHub enables collaboration and the creation of a portfolio of work
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#sec-github) for the basics of using Git and GitHub and a [project template](https://github.com/marcdotson/project-template)

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an open source publishing system that combines text, code, and output
- Quarto documents are similar to Jupyter notebooks that can be rendered into a variety of formats
- Quarto is not required for the course, but you will be required to submit code and output in a PDF format
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#sec-quarto) for more details on Quarto, including how to use Quarto to render a Jupyter notebook into a PDF

- You may use your preferred AI to assist in studying and completing assignments, but you have access to [Copilot](https://copilot.usu.edu/)
- Please remember that the objective of this course is learning
- AI can contribute to learning, including helping to debug code and explain concepts
- AI can be a detriment to learning, including when students use AI to think for them
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#sec-copilot) for details on getting access to AI and a discussion on using AI responsibly

# Assessment

## Goals and deadlines

Assignments are designed to be aligned with what you will be **expected to do in practice**

::: {.incremental}
- No credit will be given for late work unless an arrangement is made **prior to the relevant deadline**
- Please review your graded work and ask questions to avoid repeated mistakes
- Letter grades will follow the standard rubric
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Each exercise is due before the following class
- You are encouraged to work together, but you are required to submit your own work

:::

## Quizzes (30%)

Quizzes are designed to help you evaluate how well you understand the course material

::: {.incremental}

## Projects (50%)

Projects are the ultimate demonstration of learning by doing in the course, serving as the means for you to apply your conceptual understanding and skill mastery as a group within your business domain of interest

::: {.incremental}
- You will complete two group projects, one focused on multiple regression and another focused on classification
