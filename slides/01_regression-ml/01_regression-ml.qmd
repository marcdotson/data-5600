- Provide some context for what we'll be studying

# Introductions

## DATA 5600

This course introduces **machine learning** for **business applications**, including linear, logistic, and penalized regression. Students learn about the modeling process by building models and communicating results for **real-world problems**. The course focuses on the assumptions and evaluation of **interpretable models**. Prerequisites: DATA 3100 and **DATA 3300**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Build, evaluate, and interpret models to **inform** decision-making by **non-technical stakeholders**.
2. Diagnose and address violations of model assumptions to **ensure appropriate model use**.
3. **Communicate model results clearly** in a business context.

- [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is a general purpose, open source programming language
- It is the most commonly used programming language for data analytics
- Python will be required for the course
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#python) for details on how to best install and manage Python versions and project environments

- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) is a critical data tool
- I recommend [Positron](https://positron.posit.co), a next-generation data science IDE
- Positron combines the multilingual extensibility of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with essential data tools common to language-specific IDEs
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#sec-positron) for a summary of Positron's data-friendly features

- GitHub hosts version-controlled project repositories managed with Git
- It is the industry standard for software development and data projects
- Using GitHub enables collaboration and the creation of a portfolio of work
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#github) for the basics of using Git and GitHub and a [project template](https://github.com/marcdotson/project-template)

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an open source publishing system that combines text, code, and output
- Quarto documents are similar to Jupyter notebooks that can be rendered into a variety of formats
- It is not required for the course, by you will be required to submit code and output in a PDF format
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#quarto) for more details on Quarto, including how to use Quarto to render a Jupyter notebook into a PDF

- You may use your preferred AI to assist in studying and completing assignments, but you have access to Copilot
- Please remember that the objective of this course is learning
- AI can contribute to learning, including helping to debug code and explain concepts
- AI can be a detriment to learning, including when students use AI to think for them
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#copilot) for details on getting access to Copilot and a discussion on using AI responsibly

# Study and Success

## Study tips

Your focus should be on **understanding** concepts and **mastering** skills

::: {.incremental}
1. Prepare for class by previewing material and identifying questions
2. Engage during class by asking questions, taking notes, and actively coding
3. Apply what you learn in class by completing exercises and working on projects
4. Evaluate what you're learning by reviewing exercise solutions and taking quizzes
5. Reinforce what you're learning by utilizing office hours and working with classmates

# Assessment

## Goals and deadlines

Assignments are designed to be consistent with what you will be **expected to do in practice**

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
No credit will be given for late work unless an arrangement is made **prior to the relevant deadline**
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
Letter grades will follow the standard rubric

|    |         |    |        |    |        |
| :- | :------ | :- | :----- | :- | :----- |
| A  | 93-100% | B- | 80-82% | D+ | 67-69% |
| A- | 90-92%  | C+ | 77-79% | D  | 63-66% |
| B+ | 87-89%  | C  | 73-76% | D- | 60-62% |
| B  | 83-86%  | C- | 70-72% | E  | 0-59%  |
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
Please review your graded work and ask questions to avoid repeated mistakes
:::

## Exercises (20%)

Each lecture ends with an exercise that is due before the following class when one of you will be called on at random to share your exercise solution

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
You are encouraged to work together, but you are required to submit your own work
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
For each exercise, you will be randomly assigned to review one other student’s exercise
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
You won’t get credit for an exercise if you:

::: {.incremental}
1. Don’t submit your exercise on time
2. Aren’t prepared to share your exercise solution when called on at random
3. Don’t complete your randomly assigned exercise review on time
:::
:::

## Quizzes (30%)

Each quiz will be available during the associated lectures and is intended to be used as a gauge of how well students understand the course material

While students are encouraged to study in groups, each of the quizzes is to be completed individually, without assistance from other classmates

<!-- ## Interviews (30%)

During the first two weeks of class, during the two weeks in the middle of the semester, and during the final two weeks of class, you will have a required 10-minute interview with me to:

::: {.incremental}
1. Discuss the course and your efforts
2. Answer questions to evaluate your understanding of the course material
::: -->

## Projects (50%)

You will complete two group projects, one focused on multiple regression and another focused on classification

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
The groups will both present and submit a technical report
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
The week before the presentations, groups will submit a draft of their slides to get feedback and have time for revision
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
The other students in the class, as well as the group members themselves, will help evaluate each of the presentations
