# Introductions

## DATA 5600

This course introduces machine learning for **business analytics**, including linear, logistic, and penalized regression. Emphasis is on building **interpretable models**, evaluating assumptions, and communicating results, with **real-world projects** connecting modeling techniques to business decision-making. Prerequisites: DATA 3100 and DATA 3300

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Build, evaluate, and interpret models to inform decision-making for non-technical stakeholders.
2. Diagnose and address violations of model assumptions to ensure appropriate model use.
3. Communicate model results clearly in a business context.

::: {.column width="60%"}
Success in this course is demonstrating conceptual understanding and skill mastery by applying the modeling workflow in your chosen business context and as part of a group

You are each an essential member of a community of learners and should consider me as both a teacher and a mentor

- You may use your preferred AI to assist in studying and completing assignments, but you have access to [Copilot](https://copilot.usu.edu/)
- Please remember that the objective of this course is learning
- AI can contribute to learning, including helping to debug code and explain concepts
- AI can be a detriment to learning, including when students use AI to think for them
- See the [data stack training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#sec-copilot) for details on getting access to AI and a discussion on using AI responsibly

# Assessment

## Goals and deadlines

Assignments are designed to be aligned with what you will be **expected to do in practice**

::: {.incremental}
- No credit will be given for late work unless an arrangement is made **prior to the relevant deadline**
- Please review your graded work and ask questions to avoid repeated mistakes
- Letter grades will follow the standard rubric
:::

- Francis Galton fit a linear model to understand the heredity of human height
- He noticed that children of tall parents tend to be shorter and children of short parents tend to be taller and called this phenomenon, not the technique, **"regression to the mean"**
- The term "regression" came to mean fitting a model to data
- We aren't great at naming things

## Why regression *and* machine learning?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .column width="33.33%"}
**Supervised learning**

::: {.incremental}
- Learn a **mapping function** from inputs to outputs $f: X \rightarrow Y$
- If the outputs are continuous, this learned mapping function is called **regression**
- If the outputs are discrete, this learned mapping function is called **classification**
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="33.33%"}
**Unsupervised learning**

::: {.incremental}
- Learn groups and patterns in data without labeled outputs
- If we're grouping rows in a dataset, this is called **clustering**
- If we're grouping columns in a dataset, this is called **dimensionality reduction**
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="33.33%"}
**Reinforcement learning**

::: {.incremental}
- An agent learns how to interact with its environment through trial and error
- The agent can take actions in its environment
- It receives rewards or penalties based on its actions

## The mapping function is a *model*

We use models **extract information** from the data to inform decisions in the presence of uncertainty

All models predict, some are interpretable, fewer still are causal

Is the model consistent with your objective?


## {background-color="#006242"}

### Exercise 01 {.lato-font}

1. Take the course survey **on your own**
2. Read the case and write how you might go about informing the decision (no more than one page)
3. Include in your response the members of your group and two project ideas
4. Submit your response as a Word document on Canvas

## {background-color="#288DC2"}

#### Summary

- Introduced the course and each other
- Formed groups and started thinking about project ideas
- Walked through the course syllabus and answered questions
