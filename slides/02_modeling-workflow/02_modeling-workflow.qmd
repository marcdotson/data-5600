### Get Started {.permanent-marker-font}

#### Last Time

- Introduced the course and each other
- Formed groups and started thinking about project ideas
- Walked through the course syllabus and answered questions
- Provided some context for what we'll be studying this semester

#### Preview

- Walk through a high-level overview of a modeling workflow

## Why an (interpretable) modeling workflow?

::: {.incremental}
- This modeling workflow is designed to provide some **structure** as you learn about modeling data to inform business decision-making
- There are other ways to approach modeling, but I designed this workflow to **highlight essentials decisions** in the modeling process
- Just because you follow this or other workflows doesn't guarantee you'll get a good answer -- you must be **careful and thoughtful**
- The main objective of a workflow is to help you be **open and direct** about your choices and assumptions

## Formalize the objective into a function

A clearly specified objective can often be translated into a **loss function**, a mathematical expression of the thing we can optimize

$$
\ell(a, s)
$$

## Translate the data story into a model

If a model starts with a story about the *data generating process*, we need to translate it into a mathematical equation. For example:

$$
\text{sales} = 10 + 3 \times \text{promotion_spend}
$$

Think of this equation as a *function*.

- What is the input?
- What is the output?
- What is the story?

## 

We observe `sales` and `promotion_spend` in the data, but we don't observe the effect of `promotion_spend` on `sales`. 

The unobserved variables in a model are called **parameters** and are typically expressed using Greek letters:

$$
\text{sales} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{promotion_spend}
$$

Here $\beta_0$ is the amount of `sales` when there is zero `promotion_spend` and $\beta_1$ is the effect of `promotion_spend` on `sales`.

Are we missing anything to this story?

## 

To make this a *statistical* model we need to express that our model is not going to explain everything about the data:

$$\text{sales} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{promotion_spend} + \epsilon$$

Here $\epsilon$ represents **statistical error**. Think of this $\epsilon$ as including every variable beyond `promotion_spend` that effects `sales`.

## 

Every inferential model is a *simplification* of the *true* data generating process (which we don't observe). Even so, models can still help us learn about parameters, assuming the model is a good approximation of the true data generating process.

## Simulate | Simulate Data and Recover Parameters

Since the data generating process is the unobserved process that generates the data, before we work with real data where we never know the data generating process, we can assume that our model *is* the data generating process, *choose* values for the parameters, and generate or **simulate** data using the model. 

For example, we can choose values for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, simulate possible `promotion_spend` data and then simulate `sales` data.

Why? Two big reasons:

1. Prepare our data analysis before getting real data.
2. Prove our code is working by recovering parameter values.
