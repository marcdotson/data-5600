Provided more opportunities for student participation with question slides as prompts for activities, including coding, reflection, discussing with a neighbor, raising hands, speed dialogue, and whiteboarding concepts.

TODO: 

- Slow down and illustrate -- especially with case, code, questions, and activities
- Have exercises map to the project and the project rubric map to the modeling workflow
- Use minimal rubric for grades (e.g., "Excellent," "Good," "Needs Improvement")
- Learn names so you can call on students to share
- Add weekly milestones for each project?

### Interactions

- IDEA Evaluation
- Make sure post-class survey is available

- Interactions (including higher-order interactions), including interactions
- Why do we just interpret interaction effects and not main effects?
- Let's decide on the best-fitting model using cross-validation specificity?

- Does this all have to be done with the statsmodels API? What about https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/index.html?

### Multilevel Models

- Its silly to only use point estimates and its silly to assume homogeneity
- Motivate with Simpson's paradox (PML p. 80)
- Bring full circle with decision theory and heterogeneous effects
- Use the loss specification meme
