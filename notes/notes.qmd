Provided more opportunities for student participation with question slides as prompts for activities, including coding, reflection, discussing with a neighbor, raising hands, speed dialogue, and whiteboarding concepts.

TODO: 

- Slow down and illustrate -- especially with case, code, questions, and activities
- Have exercises map to the project and the project rubric map to the modeling workflow
- Use minimal rubric for grades (e.g., "Excellent," "Good," "Needs Improvement")
- Learn names so you can call on students to share
- Add weekly milestones for each project?

### Spring 2026

### Logistic Regression

- Most common GLM
- Refer to PMFs vs. PDFs
- Revisit assumptions and reconciliation
- Logistic regression assumptions and diagnostics
- If the assumptions we used previously break down, why use them at all?
- Interpreting a confusion matrix
- Prior predictive checks for helping to set priors
- This prior predictive distribution is the expected distribution of our data, given how we've specified our likelihood and priors. Does this look reasonable? No one has a negative height, for a start. At this point we can iterate on how we've specified our likelihood and priors, produce another prior predictive distribution and evaluate again, etc.
- Does Bambi have an easy way to do prior predictive checks? Or just expand our Monte Carlo simulation?
- Facet in seaborn.objects to compare the distribution of the outcome vs. the prior predictive check

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

- Generalize OLS to MLE, Generalize Confidence Intervals to Bootstrap
- Illustrate MLE vs. posterior, MLE as an approximation to a posterior
- Demonstrate likelihood being used for inference as the inverse of it being used for simulation as part of OLS-as-special-case-of-MLE discussion
- Bootstrap as poor man's posterior
- estimate, estimator, estimand meme
- They don't know how sampling theory works (what did they get before?), you need to illustrate it as well as Bayesian updating
- Can a confidence interval be interpreted the way it is for both OLS and MLE? Are we intereting confidence interval incorrecly for OLS and MLE? At what point do we need bootstrapping?
- Create a chart showing the differences between Bayesian and frequentist statistics?
- Week 03 notes from pre-PhD seminar

- Penalized Regression (Jul 15)

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- Maybe introduce interactions as well? To decide on whether or not to include them? Also include standardizing/normalizing features?
- Start with model selection as a form of "hyperparameter tuning"

### Cross-Validation

- Cross-validation is needed for hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation for model selection as well in order to keep a larger training dataset (p. 123 of PML)

## Week 11

### Fall 2025

- Penalized Regression (Nov 3)
- Variable Selection (Nov 5)

### Spring 2026

### Summer 2026

- Variable Selection (Jul 20)
- Dimension Reduction (Jul 22)

### Penalized Regression

- Generalize Regression to Penalized Regression/Bayesian Models (with PyMC?)
- Penalize the regression to learn "regular" (i.e., generalizable) features
- Ridge regression, LASSO, elastic net, best subsets, sequential replacement
- Bias-variance tradeoff and shrinkage methods
- Accuracy and precision is just bias and variance
- Shrinkage toward the MLE
- Why Bayes? Carefully and directly model uncertainty

### Variable Selection

- Stepwise regression for model selection when focusing on prediction
- Discussed the possibility of p > n
- Working from a full model and using backward or forward-selection

- Interactions (Jul 29)

### Dimension Reduction

### Principal Components Regression

- Dimension reduction as opposed to variable selection and regularization
- PCA on its own and then PCA as part of PCR

## Week 13

### Spring 2026

- Interactions (Apr 6)
- Multilevel Models (Apr 8)

### Summer 2026

### Interactions

- Interactions (including higher-order interactions), including interactions
- Why do we just interpret interaction effects and not main effects?
- Does this all have to be done with the statsmodels API? What about https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/index.html?

### Multilevel Models

- Motivate with Simpson's paradox (PML p. 80)
