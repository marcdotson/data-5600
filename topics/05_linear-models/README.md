# Linear Models


During this class we will formally introduce linear regression.

To share their solution for Exercise 04, the randomly selected student
is **Blake Bacino**.

## Learn

You can also download the slides as an .html file. Once you’ve previewed
the material and identified any questions, start watching the lecture.

Copy the Monte Carlo code for a distribution and try different parameter
values. How does the distribution change? Go the discussions to share
before continuing with the lecture.

Both frequentist and Bayesian statistics use probability to quantify
uncertainty, so how are they different? Go the discussions to share
before finishing the lecture.

## Apply

### Exercise 04

1.  Return to your simulated sales data from the previous exercise (or
    start with the exercise solution)
2.  Demonstrate that you can recover the parameters you used to simulate
    the data using either a frequentist or Bayesian model
3.  Reflect on how the interval estimates of the two approaches differ
    and how you might interpret each of them
4.  Submit your code, output, and reflection as a single PDF on Canvas

### Milestone 04

Continue working on simulating data that reflects the data generating
process/the ideal data for your project. Can you recover parameters for
your project’s simulated data using either a frequentist or Bayesian
model?
