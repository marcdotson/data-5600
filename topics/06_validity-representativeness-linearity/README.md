# Validity, Representativeness, and Linearity


During this class we will:

- Start working with real data
- Quickly review exploratory data analysis
- Begin reconciling the data and the model

Start by downloading the soft launch data. To share their solution for
Exercise 05, the randomly selected student is \*\*\_\_\_\*\*.

## Learn

You can also download the slides as an .html file. Once you’ve previewed
the material and identified any questions, start watching the lecture.

Visualize a different variable or set of variables, using some of this
example code or your own. What do you discover? Go the discussions to
share before continuing with the lecture.

Why are both validity and representativeness the most essential of the
linear regression assumptions? Go the discussions to share before
finishing the lecture.

## Data Dictionary

Transaction data from a one-week peanut butter soft launch test in a
single designated market area (DMA). Each of the 4,793 rows represents
one customer’s peanut butter category purchase behavior during the test
period.

- **customer_id**: Unique customer identifier
- **units**: Number of peanut butter jars purchased
- **sales**: Total dollar amount spent on peanut butter
- **brand**: Peanut butter brand purchased
- **promo**: Any promotion (coupon or advertisement)
- **coupon**: Coupon present
- **ad**: Advertisement present
- **loyal**: Enrolled in Harmon’s loyalty program
- **texture**: Product texture
- **size**: Jar size purchased in ounces
- **price**: Price paid per jar

### Exercise 06

1.  Clean up the soft launch data
2.  Create two interesting visualizations that help you understand the
    data and its limitations
3.  Walk through the validity, representativeness, and linearity
    assumptions and justify whether or not they are satisfied for your
    cleaned data
4.  Submit your code, output, and explanations as a single PDF on Canvas

### Milestone 06

Start working with your real project data. Conduct an exploratory data
analysis, clean up the data as needed, and walk through the validity,
representativeness, and linearity assumptions and justify whether or not
they are satisfied.
