# Independence, Constant Variance, Normality, and Identifiability


During this class we will finish assumption diagnostics and remedies.

To share their solution for Exercise 06, the randomly selected student
is \*\*\_\_\_\*\*.

## Learn

You can also download the slides as an .html file. Once you’ve previewed
the material and identified any questions, start watching the lecture.

Does your project data satisfy the independence and constant variance
assumptions? If not, what can you do? Go the discussions to share before
continuing with the lecture.

What does it mean that the variation or error is approximately normally
distributed? Go the discussions to share before finishing the lecture.

## Apply

### Exercise 07

1.  Return to your cleaned soft launch data from the previous exercise
    (or start with the exercise solution)
2.  Walk through the independence, constant variance, normality, and
    identifiabiliy assumptions and justify whether or not they are
    satisfied for your cleaned data
3.  Submit your code, output, and explanations as a single PDF on Canvas

### Milestone 07

Finish the diagnostics for your project and walk through the
independence, constant variance, normality, and identifiabiliy
assumptions and justify whether or not they are satisfied.
