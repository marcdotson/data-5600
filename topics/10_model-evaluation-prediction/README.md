# Model Evaluation and Prediction


During this class we will detail overall model fit and prediction.

To share their solution for Exercise 09, the randomly selected student
is \*\*\_\_\_\*\*.

## Learn

You can also download the slides as an .html file. Once you’ve previewed
the material and identified any questions, start watching the lecture.

Try and explain your project using the modeling workflow in three
minutes or less. Go the discussions to share before continuing with the
lecture.

After deciding on a best model, we should re-run that model using the
full dataset before interpreting results. Why? Go the discussions to
share before finishing the lecture.

## Apply

### Exercise 10

1.  Compare the models from the previous two exercises: the model that
    didn’t include the loyalty data and the model that did
2.  Choose the best-fitting model and re-run it using the full dataset
3.  Update your interpretation of the interval estimates and produce
    predictions relevant to the business objective using this final,
    best-fitting model
4.  Submit your code, output, and commentary as a single PDF on Canvas

### Milestone 10

For your project, are you unsure about whether or not to include certain
predictors in your model? Use the model evaluation techniques from this
lecture, especially decision-theoretic fit, to compare models with and
without those predictors. Choose the best-fitting model and re-run it
using the full dataset, update your interpretations, and produce
predictions relevant to your business objective.
