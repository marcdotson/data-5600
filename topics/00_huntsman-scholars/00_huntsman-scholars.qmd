### Case Task {.permanent-marker-font}

Holbrook Pickleball has rapidly scaled, but continued success requires strategic decision-making

- How can Holbrook further **differentiate itself in a competitive landscape**, and what are its **best opportunities for sustained growth**?
- Create a framework to guide the company in the next 2 to 5 years with **specific, actionable recommendations** on what their focus should be

How's it going so far?

## Clearly specify the business objective {auto-animate=true}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}
To inform business decision-making, there needs to be a **clear objective** and **limited scope**

::: {.fragment}
What are some possible business objectives?
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Maximize revenue/profit
- Increase market share
- Reduce customer churn
- Improve user satisfaction

A clear objective and limited scope leads to **specific recommendations**

## Clearly specify the business objective {auto-animate=true visibility="uncounted"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
To inform business decision-making, there needs to be a **clear objective** and **limited scope**

What are some possible business objectives?

- Maximize revenue/profit
- Increase market share
- Reduce customer churn
- Improve user satisfaction

A clear objective and limited scope leads to **specific recommendations**
:::

::: {.column .gray-box width="42%"}
How can Holbrook Pickleball differentiate itself in a competitive landscape and identify best opportunities for sustained growth?

What is the objective? Can you narrow the scope?

::: {.incremental}
- Low prices or niche products?
- Reduce costs or increase revenue?
- Repeat or new customers?
:::

## 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column .gray-box width="92%"}
In the case, let's assume our objective is to **maximize profit**, next we need to identify:

::: {.incremental}
- The **actions** we can take (e.g., launch a new product or not)
- The relevant **unknowns** (e.g., demand for the new product)
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {.fragment}
|             | **Unknowns** |             |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Actions** | Low Demand | High Demand |
| Go          | -\$20,000  | \$70,000    |
| No-Go       | \$0.00     | \$0.00      |
:::
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
::: {.incremental}
- If demand is low, what action should we take?
- If demand is high, what action should we take?
- Do we known demand? How can we learn?

## Formalize the objective as a function {auto-animate=true}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}
A clearly specified objective can be translated into an objective function, which is often a **loss function**

$$
\LARGE{\ell(a, s)}
$$

::: {.incremental}
- $a$ are **actions** we can take
- $s$ are **states of the world**
:::

::: {.fragment}
Using a loss function formalizes what we do implicitly when weighing pros and cons, exposing details and assumptions we might miss

In the case, maximizing profit uses a **utility function**

$$
\mathcal{P}(p, \mathcal{D}) = \mathcal{D}(p) \times (p - c)
$$

::: {.incremental}
- $\mathcal{D}(p)$ is demand
- $p$ is price
- $c$ is cost
:::

::: {.fragment}
For different prices $p$ (actions), we can compute profit $\mathcal{P}$ given demand $\mathcal{D}$ (state of the world)

## Decision science provides a formal framework

**Decision science** (a.k.a., **decision theory**) provides a principled, unifying framework for **informing decision-making under uncertainty**

::: {.incremental}
1. Specifying the business objective
2. Formalizing the objective as a function
3. Using data to learn about the unknown states of the world
4. Evaluating the possible actions given what we learn from data
:::

::: {.fragment}
Decision science as a framework **motivates the use of data**, helps **identify the data we need**, and provides a way to evaluate what we learn from data (e.g., model selection) that is **consistent with our objective**

# Questions?

## {background-color="#288DC2"}

### Case Work {.permanent-marker-font}

- What is the business objective you'll focus on?
- What are the actions you can take?
- What are the relevant unknowns (states of the world)?
- What data do you need to inform your decision-making?
