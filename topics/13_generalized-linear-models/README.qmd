title: "Generalized Linear Models"
format: gfm

During this class we will:

- Review linear models
- Generalize linear models beyond regression

To share their solution for Exercise 12, the randomly selected student is **___**.

## Learn

You can also download the slides as an .html file. Once you've previewed the material and identified any questions, start watching the lecture.

Why is modeling the mean of a normal distribution with a linear function of predictors a good model? Go the discussions to share before continuing with the lecture.

Discuss ideas as a group for your second project. What might the business objective and the data story be? Go the discussions to share before finishing the lecture.

## Apply

### Exercise 13

1. Simulate lead qualification data as a function of four or more predictors
2. Instead of `y`, `x1`, etc. use meaningful variable names
3. Assume `y` is distributed binomial with a linear model and logit link function
4. Use different parameter values than we did in class (keep them small)
5. Comment your code clearly
6. Visualize the simulated data using at least two different plots
7. Demonstrate that you can recover the parameters you used to simulate the data using either a frequentist or Bayesian model
8. Submit your code and printed output as a PDF on Canvas

### Milestone 13

Start with a narrative of where your data come from, a data story. Simulate data for your project consistent with this data story so you have data to work with as you finalize searching for a dataset you can use. Test your code and demonstrate you can recover parameters.
