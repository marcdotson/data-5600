### Get Started {.permanent-marker-font}

#### Last Time

- Finished building models using probability
- Demonstrated fitting models to recover parameters

#### Preview

- Formally introduce linear regression

# Simple Linear Regression



# Copy the Monte Carlo code for a distribution and try different parameter values. How does the distribution change? {background-color="#006242"}

# Multiple Linear Regression



# Both frequentist and Bayesian statistics use probability to quantify uncertainty, so how are they different? {background-color="#006242"}

# Assumptions

### Exercise 05 {.lato-font}

1. Return to your simulated sales data from the previous exercise (or start with the exercise solution)
2. Demonstrate that you can recover the parameters you used to simulate the data using both frequentist and Bayesian models
3. Reflect on how the estimates of the two approaches compare and how you might interpret them differently
4. Submit your code, output, and reflection as a single PDF on Canvas
