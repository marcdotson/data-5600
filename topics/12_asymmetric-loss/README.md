# Asymmetric Loss


## Case Overview

As a data analyst at MarketStar, you are tasked with running a lead
qualification program as part of the sales efforts for an electronics
company. The client will send over leads from various sources such as
trade shows, online website hits, etc. and the MarketStar sales team
works to convert the leads into qualified opportunities. This client
runs B2B sales, meaning the sales reps on your team reach out to
companies to see if they want to purchase electronics at scale. Once
leads are qualified, the lead gets passed back to the client to close
the sale.

If a lead is converted into a qualified opportunity and then closes, the
sales team earns a \$1,000 commission on the sale. However, if a lead is
not not converted to a qualified opportunity, the sales rep wastes time
and resources trying to convert the lead, which is an additional \$500
opportunity cost in addition to the lost commission. There are too many
leads for the sales reps to try and convert them all in the time
allotted. For the sales effort to be successful, your task is to
identify and help your sales reps work on converting leads that are
likely to be qualified.
