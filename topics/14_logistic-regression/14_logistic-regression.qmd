## Likelihoods and link functions

Using a **link function** so we can still have a linear model with a non-normal likelihood is a **generalized linear model**

::: {.incremental}
- There are lots of generalized linear models (GLMs), but **logistic regression** is the most common
- Each GLM gets its name from the **likelihood** (PMF or PDF), link function, or **inverse link function**
- Logistic regression is also known as **binomial regression**, **Bernoulli regression**, and the **logit model**
- Using a link function makes interpreting parameter estimates tricky
:::

## Multiple *linear* regression parameters

$$
\large{y_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)} \\
\large{\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{p,i}}
$$

- $\beta_0$ is the average of $y$ when $x_1 \cdots x_p = 0$
- $\beta_1$ is the average change in $y$ for every one unit increase in $x_1$, **holding all other predictors constant** (and **relative to the reference level** if discrete)

## Multiple *logistic* regression parameters

$$
\Large{y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(1, p_i)} \\
\Large{\log\left({p_i \over 1 - p_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{p,i}}
$$

Each $\beta$ represents the **log-odds** of $y = 1$ (i.e., "success") where $\beta > 0$ increases and $\beta < 0$ descrease the log-odds of $y = 1$

::: {.incremental}
- $\beta_0$ is the **log-odds** of $y = 1$ when $x_1 \cdots x_p = 0$
- $\beta_1$ is the **log-odds** of $y = 1$ for every one unit increase in $x_1$, **holding all other predictors constant** (and **relative to the reference level** if discrete)
:::

## Odds ratios and probabilities

It's not just you, **log-odds** are not intuitive

:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Odds Ratios**

::: {.incremental}
- Exponentiating the coefficients gives us **odds ratios** where $\exp(\beta) > 1$ increases and $\exp(\beta) < 1$ decreases the odds of $y = 1$ by $\exp(\beta)$ *times*
- For every one unit increase in $x_1$, the odds of $y = 1$ are *multiplied* by $\exp(\beta_1)$ or increase by $100 \times (\exp(\beta_1) - 1)\%$, **holding all other predictors constant** (and **relative to the reference level** if discrete)
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Probabilities**

::: {.incremental}
- Applying the logistic (i.e., **sigmoid**) function to the coefficients gives us **probabilities** where values closer to 1 increase and values closer to 0 decrease the probability of $y = 1$
- For every one unit increase in $x_1$, the probability of $y = 1$ changes by $\text{logistic}(\beta_1)$, **holding all other predictors constant** (and **relative to the reference level** if discrete)

## Logistic regression parameters as *log-odds*

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

import numpy as np
import polars as pl
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Set randomization seed
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)

# Specify a function to simulate data
def sim_data(n, beta_0, beta_days, beta_large, beta_trade, beta_online):
    # Simulate days since first contact using a normal distribution
    days = rng.normal(20, 5, size=n)
    # Simulate large company size using a binomial distribution
    large = rng.binomial(1, 0.3, size=n)
    # Simulate trade show contact using a binomial distribution
    trade = rng.binomial(1, 0.2, size=n)
    # Simulate online contact using a binomial distribution
    online = rng.binomial(1, 0.7, size=n)
    
    # Simulate the probability of a lead qualifying
    prob_y = (
      np.exp(beta_0 + beta_days * days + beta_large * large + beta_trade * trade + beta_online * online) / 
      (1 + np.exp(beta_0 + beta_days * days + beta_large * large + beta_trade * trade + beta_online * online))
    )
    # Use prob_y to simulate the qualifed outcome variable
    qualified = rng.binomial(1, prob_y, size=n)

    # Return the output
    return qualified, days, large, trade, online

# Call the function and save as an array
data_arr = sim_data(n = 500, beta_0 = 0.10, beta_days = -0.07, beta_large = 1, beta_trade = 0.75, beta_online = 0.25)

# Convert to a dataframe
data_df = pl.DataFrame(data_arr, schema = ['qualified', 'days', 'large', 'trade', 'online'])

# Fit a frequentist logistic regression
fr_fit = smf.glm(
    'qualified ~ days + large + trade', 
    data = data_df.to_pandas(), 
    family = sm.families.Binomial()
).fit()
```

Each $\beta$ represents the **log-odds** of $y = 1$ (i.e., "success") where $\beta > 0$ increases and $\beta < 0$ decreases the log-odds of $y = 1$

```{python}
#| eval: true

# Confidence intervals
fr_fit.conf_int()
```

::: {.fragment}
Holding all other predictors constant, we are 95% confident that for every additional day since first contact, the log-odds of a lead qualifying decreases between -0.097 and -0.017
:::

## Logistic regression parameters as *odds ratios*

Exponentiating the coefficients gives us **odds ratios** where $\exp(\beta) > 1$ increases and $\exp(\beta) < 1$ decreases the odds of $y = 1$ by $\exp(\beta)$ *times*

```{python}
#| eval: true

# Confidence intervals
np.exp(fr_fit.conf_int())
```

::: {.fragment}
Holding all other predictors constant, we are 95% confident that for a large company (relative to a small company), the odds of a lead qualifying increases between 1.61 and 3.57 times
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
For *negative* log-odds, it can be helpful to think about the **reciprocal** of the odds ratio (i.e., $1 / \exp(\beta)$) to understand how many times more likely $y = 0$ is to occur
:::

## Logistic regression parameters as *odds ratios*

Exponentiating the coefficients gives us **odds ratios** where $\exp(\beta) > 1$ increases and $\exp(\beta) < 1$ decreases the odds of $y = 1$ by $\exp(\beta)$ *times*

```{python}
#| eval: true

# Confidence intervals
100 * np.exp(fr_fit.conf_int() - 1)
```

::: {.fragment}
Holding all other predictors constant, we are 95% confident that for a large company (relative to a small company), the odds of a lead qualifying increases between 59.23% and 131.50%
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Again, for *negative* log-odds, it can be helpful to think about the **reciprocal** of the odds ratio percentage (i.e., $100 \times (1 / (\exp(\beta_1) - 1))\%$) for the odds of $y = 0$
:::

## Logistic regression parameters as *probabilities*

Applying the logistic (i.e., **sigmoid**) function to the coefficients gives us **probabilities** where values closer to 1 increase and values closer to 0 decrease the probability of $y = 1$

```{python}
#| eval: true

from scipy.special import expit

# Confidence intervals
expit(fr_fit.conf_int())
```

::: {.fragment}
Holding all other predictors constant, we are 95% confident that a lead generated at a trade show (relative to it not being generated at a trade show), the probability of a lead qualifying increases between 0.592 and 0.779
:::

## Ensuring valid inference

We need to use **diagnostics** to confirm the model assumptions are met, and **remedy** any issues, so that our interpretation (i.e., statistical inference) is valid

::: {.fragment}
1. **Validity**: Data is relevant to the objective and no predictors are missing
2. **Representativeness**: Data is representative of the data generating process or population
3. **Linearity**: The mapping function from the predictors to the outcome is additive and a linear function of the parameters
4. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other
5. **Constant Variance**: Homoscedasticity or constant variance of errors
6. **Normality**: Variation or error is normally distributed
7. **Identifiability**: Data allows for parameters to be estimated, including no strong multicollinearity

# We want to keep our model as simple as possible, so why would we use multiple logistic regression? {background-color="#006242"}

# Validity and Representativeness

## Validity

Data is relevant to the objective and no predictors are missing

::: {.fragment}
Why should we care about **omitted variables**? [What about including variables that don't matter?]{.fragment}
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Diagnostics**

::: {.incremental}
- Is the data relevant to the objective?
- How well does the data match the ideal data?
- How do the simulated and real outcomes compare?
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Fixes**

::: {.incremental}
- Get different data
- Find additional data
- Justify **proxy variables**
:::
:::

::::

## Representativeness

Data is representative of the data generating process or population

::: {.fragment}
Why should we care about the data being representative?
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Diagnostics**

::: {.incremental}
- How was the data collected?
- Is it representiave of the process or population we care about?
- Is data **missing at random**?
- Check for **influential points**
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Fixes**

::: {.incremental}
- Get different data
- **Drop or impute** missing data
- Investigate influential points and **consider** removing

# Linearity, Independence, and Identifiability

## Functional form of the deterministic component

The mapping function from the predictors to the outcome is additive and a linear function of the parameters

::: {.fragment}
If the process or population isn't approximated by an additive and linear function, what happens to our inferences?
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Diagnostics**

::: {.incremental}
- Scatterplot of **log-odds** and predictor(s)
- Partial regression plots
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Fixes**

::: {.incremental}
- Transform $X$
- Transform $y$
- Use a nonlinear model
:::
:::

::::

## Scatterplot of *log-odds* and predictor(s)

The relationship between the **log-odds** and predictor(s) should be roughly linear and **monotone** (i.e., always increasing or always decreasing) in probability

![](../../figures/temp_linearity.png){fig-align="center"}

## Independence and exchangeability

This assumption is often expressed as observations being **independent and identically distributed** (i.e., iid) or, if not identical, at least **exchangeable** (i.e., there is no order to the observations)

::: {.fragment}
In what ways could this assumption be violated (and often is)?
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Diagnostics**

::: {.incremental}
- Is the data a random sample?
- Is each observation a different unit or are there **repeat measures**?
- Are the observations **clustered** (e.g., a hierarchy or spatially corellated)?
- Is there a **sequence** to the observations (e.g., a time series)?
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Fixes**

::: {.incremental}
- Include a predictor to control for the dependence
- Use a more advanced model (i.e., multilevel, spatial, or time series model)
:::
:::

::::

## Multicollinearity and identifiability

**Multicollinearity** is when two or more predictors are highly correlated

::: {.fragment}
Why would this be a problem for identifiability (think about how we interpret the slope parameters)?
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Diagnostics**

::: {.incremental}
- Scatterplot matrix
- Correlation matrix
- Variance inflation factors (VIF)
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="50%"}
**Fixes**

::: {.incremental}
- Drop some predictors
- Use penalized regression (e.g., ridge, lasso, elastic net)
- Combine the correlated predictors (e.g., PCR)
:::
:::

::::

## Compute variance inflation factors

VIF is based on $R^2$, but we don’t have a way to calculate $R^2$ in logistic regression (i.e., the loss function used to compute the point estimates isn't quadratic, so no sums of squares)

We can still run an OLS model to compute VIF for a model with a binary outcome since our its based on the relationship among predictors and the way the model is estimated isn't relevate to estimating collinearity
