I'd like to put together a set of Python functions for checking model assumptions for both linear and logistic regression. Since I want it to work both linear and logistic regression models, diagnostics that rely on residuals should be avoided. I'm using both statsmodels and scikit-learn, but scikit-learn is preferred as much as possible.

Here are the assumptions I want diagnostics to help evaluate:

1. **Validity**: Data is relevant to the objective and no predictors are missing
2. **Representativeness**: Data is representative of the data generating process or population
3. **Linearity**: The mapping function from the predictors to the outcome is an additive, linear function of the parameters
4. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other
5. **Constant Variance**: Homoscedasticity or constant variance of errors
6. **Normality**: Variation or error is normally distributed
7. **Identifiability**: Data allows for parameters to be estimated, including no strong multicollinearity

These are functions that are meant to be accessible and comprehensible for undergraduates, so simplicity is preferred over efficiency.

There is a preference for using polars over pandas along with seaborn.objects when available followed by seaborn and matplotlib.
