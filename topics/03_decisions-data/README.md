# Decisions and Data


During this class we will:

- Discuss decision-making under uncertainty
- Start modeling data generating processes

To share their solution for Exercise 02, the randomly selected student
is \*\*\_\_\_\*\*.

## Learn

You can also download the slides as an .html file. Once you’ve previewed
the material and identified any questions, start watching the lecture.

Go to the discussions to share what actions, states of the world, and
loss/utility function might be relevant for your project before
continuing with the lecture.

What might Y, X, and their relationships be for your project? Try
drawing a graph. Keep it simple. Go the discussions to share before
finishing the lecture.

## Apply

### Exercise 03

1.  Simulate sales data (not units sold) as a function of four or more
    predictors
2.  Instead of y, x1, etc. use meaningful variable names
3.  Assume the error is distributed normal
4.  Use different parameter values than we did in class
5.  Comment your code clearly
6.  Visualize the simulated data using at least two different plots
7.  Submit your code and printed output as a PDF on Canvas

### Milestone 03

Try and formalize the objective function for your project. Is a
quadratic loss or a linear utility function appropriate? Can you make
use of the profit function we’re using for the case study? Start working
on simulating data that reflects the data generating process/the ideal
data for your project.
