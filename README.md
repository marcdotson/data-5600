## Description

This course introduces supervised learning for business applications.
Students learn about model building, feature engineering, parameter
estimation, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and communication.
The course is focused on interpretable regression and classification
models, including simple, multiple, and logistic regression.
Prerequisites/Restrictions: DATA 3100, ~~DATA 3300~~, and DATA 3500 (may
be taken concurrently)

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1.  Explain the importance of regression and machine learning in
    business.
2.  Demonstrate cleaning and structuring data for regression and machine
    learning.
3.  Build and interpret appropriate models that use data to inform
    business decisions.
4.  Clearly present model results in a business context.

## Tools

This course is heavily focused on skill-building. Each student will need
to bring a laptop, either their own or one rented from USU. All course
materials will be [available on Canvas](https://usu.instructure.com).
While students are welcome to use their preferred tools, the following
[data stack](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack) is recommended
and will be demonstrated throughout the course.

### Python

[Python](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#python)
is a general purpose, open source programming language developed by
computer scientists. It is the most commonly used programming language
for data wrangling, visualizations, and modeling.

### Positron

A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE), outside of an
open source programming language, is arguably your most important tool
as a data analyst or data engineer.
[Positron](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#sec-positron)
is a next-generation data analytics and data engineering IDE. Built on
VS Code’s [open source core](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
Positron combines the multilingual extensibility of [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with essential data tools common
to language-specific IDEs.

### GitHub

Git is a powerful collaboration and [version control
system](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/). While it is the industry
standard for software development, it is easy to adopt this framework to
provide structure for data analytics as well. GitHub is an online
hosting service where each project lives in its own repository
maintained by me as the mentor. After a project is completed, you can
copy (i.e., *fork*) the project repository for you to maintain. Learning
to use Git and GitHub not only aids in collaboration, it will ultimately
allow you to develop an online portfolio of work.

### Quarto

[Quarto](#sec-quarto) for communicating results with presentations,
reports, dashboards, etc.

For more details, refer to the [data stack
training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack).

## Studying

Students should consider the following study tips.

1.  Prepare for class by studying the assigned materials, taking notes,
    and coming with questions.
2.  Take notes, ask questions, and participate in class discussions.
3.  Consistently apply what you’re learning to your project.
4.  Work with classmates and utilize office hours.
5.  Use your class repository to organize all notes and project work.

Students should consider the following coding tips.

1.  Learn by doing: Code in class and complete exercises.
2.  Pay *careful* attention to details.
3.  Don’t code from scratch. Start with previous work and solutions.
4.  Look at and emulate good code.
5.  Literally sketch what transformed data should look like in the end.

## Assessment

All assignments are due on Canvas at the start of the class session they
are associated with in the schedule.

Letter grades will follow the standard rubric.

|     |         |     |        |     |        |
|:----|:--------|:----|:-------|:----|:-------|
| A   | 93-100% | B-  | 80-82% | D+  | 67-69% |
| A-  | 90-92%  | C+  | 77-79% | D   | 63-66% |
| B+  | 87-89%  | C   | 73-76% | D-  | 60-62% |
| B   | 83-86%  | C-  | 70-72% | E   | 0-59%  |

No credit will be given for late work unless an arrangement is made
prior to the deadline. Students are encouraged to review your graded
work and ask questions to avoid repeated mistakes. Grades will be
determined as follows.

### Exercises (20%)

Each lecture ends with an exercise that is due at the beginning of the
following class when a student will be called on at random to share
their solution. While students are encouraged to work together, each
student is required to submit their own work. Additionally, for each
exercise every student will be randomly assigned to review one other
student’s exercise.

Students won’t get credit if they don’t submit their solution on time,
aren’t present and prepared to share when called on at random, or don’t
complete their randomly assigned review.

### Quizzes (30%)

While students are encouraged to study in groups, each of the quizzes is
to be completed individually, without assistance from other classmates.
Each quiz will be available on Canvas during the associated lectures and
is intended to be used as a gauge of how well students understand the
course material.

<!-- ### Interviews
&#10;During the first two weeks of class, during the two weeks in the middle of the semester, and during the final two weeks of class each student will have a required 10-minute interview with me where we discuss the course and their efforts and evaluate their understanding in the form of an oral exam. -->

### Projects (50%)

Students will complete two group projects, one focused on multiple
regression and the second focused on classification. The groups will
both present and submit a technical report developed on a GitHub
repository. The week before the presentations, they will submit a draft
of their slides to get feedback and have time for revision. The other
students in the class, as well as the group members themselves, will
help evaluate each of the presentations.

## Schedule

Please note that the instructor reserves the right to change the
syllabus, including the schedule, at any time and for any reason. In
such circumstances, he will provide students sufficient advance notice
as it relates to assignment deadlines.
