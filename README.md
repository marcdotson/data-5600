# DATA 5600 Introduction to Regression and Machine Learning for Analytics

- Monday and Wednesday 1:30-2:45 pm
- Huntsman Hall 260

This course introduces supervised learning for business applications.
Students learn about model building, feature engineering, parameter
estimation, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and communication.
The course is focused on interpretable regression and classification
models, including simple, multiple, and logistic regression.
Prerequisites: DATA 3100 and DATA 3300

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1.  Explain the importance of regression and machine learning in
    business.
2.  Demonstrate cleaning and structuring data for regression and machine
    learning.
3.  Build and interpret appropriate models that use data to inform
    business decisions.
4.  Clearly present model results in a business context.

## Data Stack

This course is heavily focused on skill-building. Each student will need
to bring a laptop, either their own or one rented from USU. All course
materials will be [available on Canvas](https://usu.instructure.com).
While students are welcome to use their preferred tools, the following
[data stack](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack) is recommended
and certain tools are required, as indicated below.

### Python

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is
a general purpose, open source programming language developed by
computer scientists. It is the most commonly used programming language
for data wrangling, visualizations, and modeling. Python will be
required for the course. See the [data stack
training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#python)
for details on how to best install and manage Python versions and
project environments.

### Positron

A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE), outside of an
open source programming language, is a data analyst’s most important
tool. [Positron](https://positron.posit.co) is a next-generation data
analytics IDE. Built on VS Code’s [open source
core](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), Positron combines the
multilingual extensibility of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
with essential data tools common to language-specific IDEs. See the
[data stack
training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#sec-positron)
for a summary of Positron’s data-friendly features.

### GitHub

GitHub is an online hosting service for project repositories managed
using Git, a powerful collaboration and [version control
system](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/) and the industry standard
for software development and data projects. Git and GitHub facilitates
collaboration on a single code base and enables students to organize an
online portfolio of work. See the [data stack
training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#github)
for the basics of using Git and GitHub and a [project
template](https://github.com/marcdotson/project-template).

### Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an open source publishing system that
combines text, code, and output. Quarto documents are similar to Jupyter
notebooks, except the content can be rendered into a variety of formats,
including PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Revealjs slide
decks, interactive dashboards, websites, etc. While Quarto is not
required for the course, students will be required to submit code and
output in a PDF format. See the [data stack
training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#quarto)
for more details on using Quarto, including how to use Quarto to render
a Jupyter notebook into a PDF.

### AI

Students have access through Utah State to Copilot and may use their
preferred AI to assist in studying and completing assignments. However,
students must remember that the objective of this course is learning. AI
can contribute to learning, including helping to debug code and explain
concepts in new ways. AI can also be a detriment to learning, including
when students use AI to think for them. See the [data stack
training](https://github.com/marcdotson/data-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#ai)
for details on using AI responsibly.

## Resume Building

Example…

## Studying

Students should consider the following study tips.

1.  Prepare for class by studying the assigned materials, taking notes,
    and coming with questions.
2.  Take notes, ask questions, and participate in class discussions.
3.  Consistently apply what you’re learning to your project.
4.  Work with classmates and utilize office hours.
5.  Use your class repository to organize all notes and project work.

Students should consider the following coding tips.

1.  Learn by doing: Code in class and complete exercises.
2.  Pay *careful* attention to details.
3.  Don’t code from scratch. Start with previous work and solutions.
4.  Look at and emulate good code.
5.  Literally sketch what transformed data should look like in the end.

## Assessment

All assignments are due on Canvas at the start of the class session they
are associated with in the schedule.

Letter grades will follow the standard rubric.

|     |         |     |        |     |        |
|:----|:--------|:----|:-------|:----|:-------|
| A   | 93-100% | B-  | 80-82% | D+  | 67-69% |
| A-  | 90-92%  | C+  | 77-79% | D   | 63-66% |
| B+  | 87-89%  | C   | 73-76% | D-  | 60-62% |
| B   | 83-86%  | C-  | 70-72% | E   | 0-59%  |

No credit will be given for late work unless an arrangement is made
prior to the deadline. Students are encouraged to review your graded
work and ask questions to avoid repeated mistakes. Grades will be
determined as follows.

### Exercises (20%)

Each lecture ends with an exercise that is due at the beginning of the
following class when a student will be called on at random to share
their solution. While students are encouraged to work together, each
student is required to submit their own work. Additionally, for each
exercise every student will be randomly assigned to review one other
student’s exercise.

Students won’t get credit if they don’t submit their solution on time,
aren’t present and prepared to share when called on at random, or don’t
complete their randomly assigned review.

### Quizzes (30%)

While students are encouraged to study in groups, each of the quizzes is
to be completed individually, without assistance from other classmates.
Each quiz will be available on Canvas during the associated lectures and
is intended to be used as a gauge of how well students understand the
course material.

<!-- ### Interviews
&#10;During the first two weeks of class, during the two weeks in the middle of the semester, and during the final two weeks of class each student will have a required 10-minute interview with me where we discuss the course and their efforts and evaluate their understanding in the form of an oral exam. -->

### Projects (50%)

Students will complete two group projects, one focused on multiple
regression and the second focused on classification. The groups will
both present and submit a technical report developed on a GitHub
repository. The week before the presentations, they will submit a draft
of their slides to get feedback and have time for revision. The other
students in the class, as well as the group members themselves, will
help evaluate each of the presentations.

## Schedule

Please note that the instructor reserves the right to change the
syllabus, including the schedule, at any time and for any reason. In
such circumstances, he will provide students sufficient advance notice
as it relates to assignment deadlines.
