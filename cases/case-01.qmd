As a data analyst communicates with domain experts to understand the problem and how to inform the decision, a decision theoretic approach requires specifying an objective function that is consistent with the problem and captures the risk aversion of the decision maker. For this problem, a simple customer-specific profit function suffices:

$$
\pi(p) = Y(p) \times (p - mc)
$$

where p is the personalized price for the given customer, Y(p) is the predicted demand for the given customer, and mc is the marginal cost. In decision theory, the objective function is typically a loss function. We can identify an optimal decision, conditioned on the specification of the objective function, by minimizing the loss function or equivalently, as we have here, maximizing a utility or profit function.

SLR-Like

Actions: Go or no-go
State of the World: Consumer demand (units sold)
Objective Function: Profit function

MLR-Like

Actions: Go or no-go and pricing decision
State of the World: Consumer demand (units sold as a function of price)
Objective Function: Profit function
